# Experiment No: 3-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - perform bitwise and or on the given integer values.

## AIM
To Write a python program to perform bitwise and or on the given integer values.

## ALGORITHM
1. Prompt the user to enter the first integer value.

2.Read the first integer value from the user and store it in a variable.

3.Prompt the user to enter the second integer value.

4.Read the second integer value from the user and store it in a variable.

5.Perform the bitwise AND operation on the two integers and store the result.

6.Perform the bitwise OR operation on the two integers and store the result.

7.Print the result of the bitwise AND operation.

8.Print the result of the bitwise OR operation.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223070021
#Name-Ragunandhan S
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print(a&b)
print(b|a)

```
