## Experiment No: 4 – Conditional Statements- Checking the number is divisible by 9 or not
## AIM  
To Write a Python program to read a number and check whether the number is divisible by 9 or not using  if else
## ALGORITHM  
1. Take the input number from the user.

2.Check if the number is divisible by 9 using the condition number % 9 == 0.

3.If the condition is true, output that the number is divisible by 9.

4.If the condition is false, output that the number is not divisible by 9.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223070021
# Name-Ragunandhan S
a=int(input())
if(a%9==0):
    print(a,"is divisible by 9")
else:
    print(a,"is NOT divisible by 9")
```
