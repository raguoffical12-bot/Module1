# Experiment No: 1 Python Basics- Printing integer literal

## AIM  
To Write a python program to print the following integer literals.

## ALGORITHM  
1.Define the integer variable and assign it the value 123_456_789 using underscores to improve readability.

2.Use the print() function to output the value of the integer variable.

3.The underscores in the number will be ignored by Python, but the value remains 123456789.

4.The program will print the integer 123456789 as output when executed.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223070021
# Name-Ragunandhan S
num = 123_456_789
print(num)
```
## OUTPUT
